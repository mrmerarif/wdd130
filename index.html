        <p>I'm originally from Mexico and have lived in the USA for nearly 30 years. I love learning
            new things, lately I've been teaching myself piano and guitar. I also enjoy woodworking,
            cooking for my family, playing with my kids, reading, and traveling. Staying curious
            keeps life interesting. About 30 years ago, I started an Aviation degree but couldn’t
            finish due to financial challenges. I did complete a two-year college degree, and now
            I'm working toward a bachelor's in computer science, with plans to earn a master's in
            the same field.</p>
