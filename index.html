        <p>I'm originally from Mexico and have lived in the USA for nearly 30 years. I love learning
            new things, lately I've been teaching myself piano and guitar. I also enjoy woodworking,
            cooking for my family, playing with my kids, reading, and traveling. Staying curious
            keeps life interesting.
            About 30 years ago, I started an Aviation degree but couldn’t finish due to financial
            challenges. I did complete a two-year college degree, and now I'm working toward a
            bachelor's in computer science, with plans to earn a master's in the same field.</p>
